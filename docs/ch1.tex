\section{Shape}
Given a set $S$, a \textbf{sequence} is an ordered list of zero or finite many elements from $S$.
A sequence of length $r$ can be represented by a map
\begin{align*}
    i : \{0, \dots, r - 1\} \to S
\end{align*}
it can be writtern as an $r$-tuple
\begin{align*}
    (i_0, \dots, i_{r - 1})
\end{align*}

A \textbf{shape} is a sequence of elements from $\mathbb N$.
